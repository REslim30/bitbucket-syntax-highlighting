## Manual Tests
This is a temporary testing strategy for the tests until a more automated solution is implemented.

- Go onto a PR and check if most things are highlighted
- Open up bitbucket.org and travel to the PRs and check if they're highlighted
- Push a change to a PR and reload the page and check if they're still highlighted
